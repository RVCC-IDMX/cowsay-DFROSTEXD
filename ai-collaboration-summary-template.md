# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** William Harvey

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: Getting the prerequisites for the project

**My prompt:**

> alright, here's what I need you to do

Initialize a new npm project and install cowsay

**What happened:**

I actually had a tough time with this, even though it's the easiest. At first I realized that I needed to have the node.js file installed, but when I did that, the AI still said that it wasn't installed, I opened new terminals and restarted VS code, but it still gave me an error. Once I did it manually did it then work.

### Interaction 2: Setting up the tutorial-package-json.md file

**My prompt:**

> /explain What is each field in this file?

**What happened:**

It was able to tell me how each field in the package.json file works, as well as an example and what would happen if it was missing. I did ask the agent to make it easier to understand for begginers though.

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

[1-2 sentences about what this file explains and whether you edited Agent's output]
This file explains what each field is meant to be doing when they are called on. I did not edits the agents output, reason for that was that the AI (in my opinion) did a good job with being thorough and giving some easy to understand examples of each field.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

While I had issues during this run, I know that the agent works really well with setting things up, and works with and asks you before implimenting the new content. It was very thorough with its 

### What you learned (required)

The most useful thing I learned was probably being able to make some new scripts in the package.json file. I wasn't aware that you were able to do it that easily. I feel like that will come in handy in the future.

### Optional questions

Answer any of these that interest you:

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages? How did they compare to your own?
- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?

## Optional

**Approximate time spent working with AI:** [e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour]

**Favorite cowsay creature:** [Which one and why?]
